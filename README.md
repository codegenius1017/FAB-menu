# FloatingActionButtons Menu (FABsMenu)

Just a simple library to use a menu with `FloatingActionButton`s from Design Support Library and following [guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html#buttons-floating-action-button-transitions)


## Usage

Add jitpack dependency to your root `build.gradle`:
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

And add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'me.jahirfiquitiva:FABsMenu:1.0.0'
}
```

To see how the buttons are added to your xml layouts, check the sample project.
